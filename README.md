-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**GeoGuessr** is a game where the player is placed in a random location from Google Street View
and has to mark where they are on the world map based on what they can see.

**easyguessr** makes this easier by allowing you to select specific filters relating to what
you could be seeing in a game of GeoGuessr. Using these filters you can narrow down your
guesses. For example the filter "left-hand traffic" will show you countries such as the UK,
where people drive on the left side of the road.
This can not only help you win a game of GeoGuessr, but also teach you how to do it yourself.

The information for these filters was taken from the following websites:
