About easyguessr (and GeoGuessr)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**GeoGuessr** is a game where the player is placed in a random location from Google Street View
and has to mark where they are on the world map based on what they can see.

**easyguessr** makes this easier by allowing you to select specific filters related to what
you could be seeing in a game of GeoGuessr. Based on these filters the website shows you
countries that they apply to. For example the filter "left-hand traffic" will show you
countries such as the UK, where people drive on the left side of the road.
This can help you guess more accurately and learn many GeoGuessr tricks.

The information for these filters was taken from the following websites:
